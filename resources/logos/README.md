# Preset Logos

This folder contains preset logos that users can select directly from the application.

## Adding Preset Logos

To add preset logos:

1. Place your logo image files in this folder (`resources/logos/`)
2. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WebP, GIF, SVG
3. The logos will automatically appear in the "Select Logo" section
4. Users can click on any preset logo to select it, or choose a custom logo using the "Choose Custom Logo" button

## Logo Recommendations

- **Format**: PNG with transparency is recommended for best results
- **Size**: Logos will be automatically resized, but starting with a high-resolution image (at least 500x500px) is recommended
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names (e.g., `company-logo.png`, `watermark-icon.png`)

The application will automatically generate thumbnails for all logos in this folder.
